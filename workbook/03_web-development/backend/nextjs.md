## Next.js with App Router

- The App Router is a new feature introduced in Next.js 13 that allows for a more flexible and powerful way to define routes and layouts in Next.js applications.
- It provides a new way to define routes and layouts using a file-based routing system.
- The App Router allows for nested routes, dynamic routes, and layout composition.
- It also provides a new way to define layouts using React components, which allows for more flexibility and control over the layout of the application.
- The App Router is designed to work seamlessly with the existing pages directory and can be used alongside it.
- The App Router is built on top of React Router and provides a similar API for defining routes and layouts.
- The App Router is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple API for defining routes and layouts.
- The App Router is designed to be extensible and can be customized to fit the needs of the application.

## Next.js without App Router

- Next.js can be used without the App Router, which is a new feature introduced in Next.js 13.
- The App Router is an alternative to the traditional pages directory and provides a new way to define routes and layouts in Next.js applications.
- It allows for more flexibility and control over routing and layout management.
- However, Next.js can still be used with the traditional pages directory and the existing routing system.
- The traditional pages directory is still supported and can be used for building applications without the App Router.
- The pages directory is the default way to define routes in Next.js applications.
- The pages directory is a special directory in Next.js that contains React components that define the routes of the application.
