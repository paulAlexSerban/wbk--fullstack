# Backend

-   server-side code written with Node.js and Express.js

## API vs Service vs Middleware

Here are the bullet points to differentiate between API, service, and middleware in a microservice architecture:

### API (Application Programming Interface)

-   **Interface for Interaction**: APIs are interfaces through which different software components communicate with each other. In a microservice architecture, APIs enable microservices to interact with each other and with external clients.
-   **Data Exchange Format**: They define the way data is exchanged between services, often using formats like JSON or XML.
-   **Protocol and Endpoint Definition**: APIs specify the protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) and endpoints for access, ensuring standardized interaction.
-   **Contract Between Services**: Serve as a contract between services, detailing available operations, input/output data structures, and error handling mechanisms.

### Service

-   **Independent Component**: A service in a microservice architecture is an independent, self-contained component that performs a specific business function or process.
-   **Deployable Unit**: Each service is a deployable unit, meaning it can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services.
-   **Own Data Management**: Typically, each service manages its own data and database, ensuring data encapsulation and independence.
-   **Inter-service Communication**: Services often communicate with each other through APIs but can also use other methods like messaging queues.

### Middleware

-   **Facilitates Communication**: Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system.
-   **Data Transformation and Routing**: It handles data transformation, message queuing, and routing between services, often working behind the scenes.
-   **Connects Heterogeneous Systems**: Middleware can connect different systems and services, facilitating communication and data exchange between diverse and disparate components of a microservice architecture.
-   **Supports Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Often used to address cross-cutting concerns like security, logging, and transaction management, providing a layer where shared functionalities can be implemented.

In a microservice architecture, these components play distinct yet complementary roles, with APIs enabling interaction, services focusing on business functionalities, and middleware providing the glue and common functionalities across services.

## Questions to Determine if it's an API, Service, or Middleware

To help decide whether a component in your architecture is an API, a service, or middleware, you can ask yourself the following questions:

### Questions to Determine if it's an API:

1. **Does it Define a Set of Operations?**: Does this component define a set of operations that can be performed, such as retrieving data or executing a function?
2. **Is it a Communication Interface?**: Is its primary function to serve as an interface for communication between different parts of the system or with external systems?
3. **Does it Use Standard Protocols?**: Does it use standard communication protocols like HTTP, REST, or SOAP?
4. **Is there a Contract or Documentation?**: Is there a formal contract or documentation (like Swagger or OpenAPI) that describes how to interact with this component?

### Questions to Determine if it's a Service:

1. **Does it Perform a Specific Business Function?**: Is this component responsible for a specific business function or process in the system?
2. **Is it Independently Deployable?**: Can this component be deployed independently of other components in the system?
3. **Does it Own its Data?**: Does this component manage its own data or state independently?
4. **Does it Have its Own Database or State Management?**: Does it have its own database or a unique way of managing state?

### Questions to Determine if it's Middleware:

1. **Does it Facilitate Communication Between Components?**: Is the main role of this component to facilitate communication or data exchange between different parts of the system?
2. **Does it Provide Common Services?**: Does it provide common services like authentication, logging, caching, or message queuing that are used by other components?
3. **Is it Transparent to End Users?**: Is its operation typically transparent to the end users and only apparent to system developers or operators?
4. **Does it Operate Behind the Scenes?**: Does it work 'behind the scenes' to connect, support, or enhance the capabilities of other components without being a direct part of the business functionality?

By answering these questions, you can more clearly define whether a particular component in your architecture is best classified as an API, a service, or middleware.
