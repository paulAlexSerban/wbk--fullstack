## What is API Integration?
**API Integration** is the process of connecting different software applications, systems, or services through their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable them to communicate, share data, and work together seamlessly. It's essentially the "plumbing" that allows different software components to talk to each other.

Key Concepts:
1. API (Application Programming Interface): A set of protocols, routines, and tools that specify how software components should interact
2. Integration: The process of combining different systems to function as a unified whole
3. Data Exchange: APIs enable structured data transfer between systems in formats like JSON, XML, or others

Types of API Integration:
- REST APIs: Most common, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- GraphQL: Query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data
- SOAP: Protocol-based integration using XML
- Webhooks: Event-driven integrations that push data when events occur
- Message Queues: Asynchronous communication between services

Common Use Cases:
- Payment Processing: Integrating Stripe, PayPal, or other payment gateways
- Social Media: Connecting to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram APIs
- Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure integrations
- Third-party Services: Email services, SMS providers, analytics tools
- Microservices: Internal API communication between different services

Benefits:
- Modularity: Keep systems separate while enabling communication
- Scalability: Scale individual components independently
- Flexibility: Easily swap or upgrade integrated services
- Time-to-Market: Leverage existing services instead of building from scratch
- Specialization: Use best-in-class solutions for specific needs
