- Type: Messaging Pattern (Mediation)
- Purpose: Decouples clients and servers by introducing a broker that mediates communication between them. The broker handles tasks like message routing, transformation, and delivery.
- Use Case: When you need to enable communication between multiple systems without them knowing about each other directly.
- Example:
  A service-oriented architecture (SOA) where a broker routes requests to the appropriate service.
  Middleware like Apache ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ acting as a broker.
