- Type: Processing Pattern (Integration)
- Purpose: Breaks down a complex processing task into a series of smaller, independent steps (filters) connected by data streams (pipes). Each filter processes data and passes it to the next filter.
- Use Case: When you need to process data in stages, with each stage performing a specific transformation or operation.
- Example:
  ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for data processing.
  Unix shell commands like cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | sort.
