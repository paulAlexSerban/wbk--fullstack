# Microservice Architecture

- Definition: An architecture where the application is divided into small, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
- Advantages:
  - Independent scaling and deployment of services.
  - Technology-agnostic (different services can use different tech stacks).
  - Fault isolation (failure in one service doesnâ€™t bring down the whole system).
- Disadvantages:
  - Increased complexity in managing distributed systems.
  - Requires robust DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD, monitoring).
  - Higher latency due to inter-service communication.
