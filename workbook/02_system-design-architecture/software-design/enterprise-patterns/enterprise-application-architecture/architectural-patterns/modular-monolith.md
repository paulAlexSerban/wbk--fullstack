# Modular Monolith

- Definition: A monolithic application structured into distinct, independent modules with clear boundaries, often enforcing separation through libraries or packages.
- Advantages:
  - Retains simplicity of deployment while improving maintainability.
  - Easier to refactor into microservices later.
  - Reduces coupling between components.
- Disadvantages:
  - Still deployed as a single unit, so scaling is limited.
  - Requires discipline to enforce modular boundaries.
