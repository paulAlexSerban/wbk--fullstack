# Layered Architecture

- Definition: A traditional architecture pattern where the application is divided into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access), each with a specific responsibility.
- Advantages:
  - Clear separation of concerns.
  - Easy to understand and maintain.
  - Works well for traditional, monolithic applications.
- Disadvantages:
  - Can lead to inefficiencies (e.g., unnecessary data passing between layers).
  - Not well-suited for highly scalable or distributed systems.
