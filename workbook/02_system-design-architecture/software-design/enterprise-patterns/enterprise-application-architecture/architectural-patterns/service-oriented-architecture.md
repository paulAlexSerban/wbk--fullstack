# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- Definition: An architecture where the application is composed of loosely coupled services that communicate over a network, typically using standardized protocols (e.g., SOAP, REST).
- Advantages:
  - Promotes reusability of services across applications.
  - Decouples business logic into distinct services.
  - Scalable and flexible for large systems.
- Disadvantages:
  - Can become complex to manage as the number of services grows.
  - Often criticized for being heavyweight compared to microservices.
