# Event-Driven Architecture

- Definition: A system where components communicate by producing and consuming events, often using a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- Advantages:
  - Decoupled components, enabling scalability and flexibility.
  - Asynchronous communication improves performance.
  - Suitable for real-time systems (e.g., IoT, financial systems).
- Disadvantages:
  - Debugging and monitoring can be challenging.
  - Requires careful design to handle eventual consistency.
  - Increased complexity in managing event flows.
